<!-- This page is intended to teach users about Git Internals. 
It has a scrollable tutorial on the right half of the screen and a web terminal on the left half.
The terminal has not been incorporated yet, as the Kubernetes integration is still a work in progess (View the Web-Terminal repository).
In a later iteration of the application, there should be many tutorials similar to this one, allowing us to transition away from LearnGitBranching. -->

      <h1>Git Internals</h1>
      <p> In this section, you will learn about the underlying data structures in git. 
        You will be prompted to type commands into the simulated terminal and see how they impact your workspace, index, local repository, and remote repository.
        Further, you will be introduced to trees, blobs, and commits, the main object models used by Git. 
      </p>

      <h2>Workspaces</h2>
      <p> Workspaces refer to your local file folder present on your laptop. This is where you are making your edits. 
        When you modify code file, you are modifying it in your workspace. 
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class = "slides">
      <h2>Index</h2>
      <p> The index, or cache, is the place on your local machine where your files are typically stored before they are committed to your local repository.
        When you modify a file in your workspace and then type the command "git add modified_file", the file gets added to your index.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class = "slides">
      <h2>Local Repository</h2>
      <p> Git is a distributed version control system rather than a centralized version control system. 
        This means that each user who cloned the repository gets the complete codebase, which contains the full version history. 
        Thus, there isn't only one working codebase present on a server, but rather, every user has their own functional codebase on their local machine. 
        If a user wants to commit code and revert changes, they do not need to connect with a remote repository on the server, but rather just utilizes the 
        local repository on their machine.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class = "slides">
      <h2>Remote Repository</h2>
      <p> The remote repository is a repository hosted on an online server. It's main purpose is to enable collaboration between users and the sharing of code.
        You can pull code from a remote repository to your local repository using "git pull" and you can push code from your local repository to the remote repository using "git push".
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class = "slides">
      <h2>Practice</h2>
      <p> Here, you will type some common Git commands into the simulated terminal to better understand the aforementioned concepts. To begin, let's practice initializing your workspace. 
        Try typing in the command "git clone sample_repository"  to clone the files from a remote repository into your workspace. 
        Currently, the files in your workspace, index, local repository and remote repository are all the same. 
        Now, let's imagine that you made some modification to one of the files in your local repository. Lets call this file modified-file. 
        In order to add this file to our index, type the command "git add modified-file". 
        Now, lets commit this change to our local repository. Type the command "git commit modified-file". 
        Finally, if you wanted to push this change back to the remote repository, you would type the command "git push origin".
        Congratulations! You have successfully learned about Git lifestyle changes!

      <h2>Blobs</h2>
      <p> Blobs store the binary data in a single file. They typically do not contain any metadata, and are sometimes referred to as octet or byte streams. 
        They are stored in the object database present in the .git/objects/ path in your root directory. You create a new blob when you use the "git add" command. 
        You can also sometimes create new blob objects when using "git merge" or "git rebase" if these commands change the content within an existing file.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class = "slides">
      <h2>Trees</h2>
      <p> Trees are used to connect a blob with its file name and file path within a directory. This is necessary, as a blob only contains the binary data of a file, and none of its metadata. 
        Just like blobs, trees are stored in the object database present in the .git/objects/ path in your root directory. As mentioned above, a blob is created when the user types the "git add" command. 
        Afterwards, a cache entry is added into the index located in .git/index, which conatins the name of the file, the path, the file's permissions, and the blob's hash.
        Afterwords, when the user types "git commit", a tree object is generated using the contents within the cache and depicts the current status of the working directory. 
        A phrase that you may hear is called "Git's three trees". These trees refer to the three main versions of the files that are being managed by Git. 
        The first tree is the "HEAD". This refers to the files in the last commit that was done. 
        The second tree is the "Index". These are the cache entries present in the index, which were created after the "git add" command, but have not been committed yet.
        Finally, the last tree is the "Working Directory". These are the files that are present in your workspace but have not been added to the index. 
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class = "slides">
      <h2>Commits</h2>
      <p> Commit objects depict the state of an author's working directory at a particular point in time. All of the commit objects are stored within Git, creating a complete version history. 
        A user can navigate to a previous version of a directory using the "git checkout" command. 
        Besides the initial (or root) commit, every commit has at least one "parent", which is a reference to the previous commit on the branch.  
        Some commits have more than two parents. For example, a merge commit stores references to the commits being merged. 
        Just like trees and blobs, commits are stores in the .git/objects/ path.
